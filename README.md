##This Project is a simple to do list project for beginners.

1. I built it by covering a range of topics like reducer hooks and context, it could have been built using a simpler approach but i just wanted to cover more topics.

2. I actually took this ui from the coding ninja exercise, but haven't submitted it or something because i was just looking for some react problems(the coding standards are not met).
